         <h2>Ingredients</h2>
         <ul>
            
            <li>1 pound fresh green beans, trimmed and snapped in half</li>
            
             <li>3 tablespoons butter </li>
            
             <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            
             <li>⅛ teaspoon lemon-pepper seasoning, or more to taste</li>
            
             <li>salt to taste</li>
         
        </ul>

        <h3>Directons</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place green beans into a large skillet and cover 
                with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to 
                medium-low and simmer until beans just start to 
                soften, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain and return to the 
                skillet.
            </li>
            
            <li>Add butter and stir until melted, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>

            <li>Add garlic; cook until tender and fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>

            <li>Season with lemon-pepper seasoning and salt before serving.</li>

        </ol>

        <h3>In the Ingredients section, you will see trimmed greenbeans.
            Not to worry, here is an easy way to accomplish just that! 
        </h3>

        <h4>Follow these simple instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>First, line up the green beans on your cutting board 
            so the tips are all even. You can either keep them 
            omewhat bunched up or spread them out.</li>
        
            <li>Next, using a chef's knife or paring knife, 
                cut off the tips with just one slice.</li>

            <li>Flip the beans so the tips will be closer to the 
                hand you cut with, and realign them if necessary.
                 Once again, slice the green beans in a single 
                 motion.</li>   
        
        </ol> </p>
        <p>
            And just like that, you're done! If you want shorter
            green beans, you can line them up again and cut them 
            to your desired length. For this buttery garlic green 
            beans recipe, you'll just need to cut your trimmed 
            green beans in half. So easy!
