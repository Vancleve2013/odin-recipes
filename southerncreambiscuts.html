    <p>
        Biscuits are hotly debated, but to me these bring together
         all the best aspects of any great biscuit. They are just 
         salty enough, crispy around the edges, soft and tender 
         in the middle, and never dry or crumbly. There's nothing
          dusty or bland about these beautiful 
          Southern cream biscuits!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour</li>
        
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>

        <li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>

        <li>¼ teaspoon baking soda</li>

        <li>6 tablespoons cold salted butter, cubed</li>

        <li>½ cup whole milk</li>

        <li>½ cup heavy whipping cream</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon sour cream</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a 
            baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>

        <li>Combine flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda 
            in the bowl of a food processor; pulse to mix. Drop 
            cold cubes of butter into the dry mix and pulse just 
            until mix comes together and forms a ball, about 4 to 5 times; 
            do not overmix.</li>
            
        <li>Pour milk, cream, and sour cream into the dry mixture 
            in the food processor and pulse until it just comes 
            together and forms a ball, 4 to 5 times. Do not overmix! </li>    
    
        <li>Use a butter knife or sturdy rubber spatula to pry the dough 
            out of the food processor and turn it onto a well-floured 
            surface; dough will be very sticky. Don't use your fingers! 
            They're too hot and will start melting the butter.</li>

        <li>Sprinkle a little flour on top of the dough and gently
             knead until it comes together into a ball, about 4 to
              5 times. Be gentle and do not overwork the dough; 
              you are developing flaky layers and not really 
              mixing it at this point. Gently shape dough into a 
              rectangle and pat to a 1 1/2-inch thickness.</li>

        <li>Use a non-serrated knife to cut dough into 6 square 
            biscuits. Place on the prepared baking sheet so 
            squares are just touching.</li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown on top,
             about 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and cool on a 
             wire rack. Break biscuits apart just before serving.</li>
    
        </ol>
